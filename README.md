#### Description:
Tetris is a popular game that almost people know and has played. It was created by Alexey Leonidovich Pajitnov in 1984. I remember spending a lot of time trying to get a higher score than my younger brother in this game. Tetris is easy to play, you try to control the four-block puzzles with many different shapes into the approriate position to fill full of rows and you get scores after doing that. The goal of the game is to prevent the blocks from stacking up to the top of the screen for as long as possible. Thatâ€™s why you need high concentration and anticipation of potential moves to start an important strategy. And once you'd finished the game, you felt as if you were actually relaxed. I have many ideas but I decided  to create this game because it is associated with my childhood. Developing this game help me improve coding skills, problem solving skills. I hope you have a greet time playing this game.

Gameplay:
1. Falling Blocks: Tetris starts with a single tetromino (a shape composed of four blocks) falling from the top of the screen.
2. Movement: Use the arrow keys to move the falling tetromino left or right. Press the down arrow key to make it fall faster.
3. Rotation: Use the up arrow key to rotate the tetromino pieces so they fit into the existing blocks.
4. Clearing Lines: When you complete a horizontal line of blocks without any gaps, that line will disappear, giving you points.
5. Scoring: The score typically increases as you clear more lines
6. Game Over: If the blocks reach the top of the screen, the game ends.
Enjoy plaing Tetris!
